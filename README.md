# Quickstudy

A simple program to help studying. Currently, all questions have to be programmed into the source but I am working on fixing that. 

## Running

``` shell
$ git clone https://www.github.com/feistykit/quickstudy
$ cd quickstudy
$ cargo run
```

Requires [Rust](https://www.rustup.rs) and [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) installed.
